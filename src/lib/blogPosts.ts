# How Often Should You Get an Eye Test?

Regular eye examinations are essential for maintaining good eye health and detecting potential problems early. But how often should you actually get your eyes tested?

## General Guidelines

### Adults (18-60 years)
If you're an adult with no known vision problems or risk factors, you should have an eye test **at least every two years**. This is the recommendation from the College of Optometrists and the NHS.

### Over 60s
Once you reach 60, it's recommended to have annual eye tests. As we age, we become more susceptible to eye conditions such as:
- Cataracts
- Glaucoma
- Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
- Diabetic retinopathy

### Children
Children should have their eyes tested:
- Before starting school (around age 4-5)
- Every year during their school years
- More frequently if they wear glasses or have vision problems

## When to Get Tested More Frequently

You should have more frequent eye tests if you:

### Have Existing Eye Conditions
If you wear glasses or contact lenses, or have been diagnosed with an eye condition, your optometrist will recommend how often you should be tested.

### Have Diabetes
Diabetic patients should have annual eye screenings as diabetes can affect the blood vessels in your eyes, leading to diabetic retinopathy.

### Have a Family History
If close family members have had glaucoma or other eye diseases, you may need more frequent tests.

### Work with Screens
If you spend long hours working on computers or digital devices, regular eye tests can help detect early signs of digital eye strain.

## NHS Free Eye Tests

You're entitled to a free NHS eye test if you:
- Are under 16 (or under 19 and in full-time education)
- Are 60 or over
- Have diabetes or glaucoma
- Are 40 or over and have a close relative with glaucoma
- Are registered as partially sighted or blind
- Receive certain benefits

## Warning Signs Between Tests

Book an eye test sooner if you experience:
- Sudden vision changes
- Eye pain or discomfort
- Frequent headaches
- Difficulty seeing at night
- Floaters or flashes of light
- Double vision

## What Happens During an Eye Test?

At Eyesite Opticians, a comprehensive eye examination includes:

1. **Visual Acuity Test** - Testing how well you see at various distances
2. **Refraction Test** - Determining your exact prescription
3. **Eye Health Check** - Examining the health of your eyes

5. **OCT Scan** - Advanced imaging of the back of your eye (recommended)

# Choosing the Perfect Glasses for Your Face Shape

Selecting the perfect pair of glasses is about more than just vision correction – it's a fashion statement that can enhance your natural features. Here's our comprehensive guide to finding frames that suit your face shape.

## Determining Your Face Shape

Before choosing frames, identify your face shape by looking in a mirror:

- Straight cheek line
- Long nose

## Best Frames for Each Face Shape

### Oval Face - The Lucky One
Oval faces are the most versatile and suit almost any frame style!

**Best choices:**

- Cat-eye styles
- Aviators

**Avoid:** Frames that are too large and overwhelm your features

### Round Face - Add Definition
**Best choices:**
- Rectangular frames

**Avoid:** Round or circular frames that emphasize roundness

**Avoid:** Rectangular or geometric frames

### Heart-Shaped Face - Balance the Width
**Best choices:**
- Bottom-heavy frames
- Round or oval shapes
- Aviators

**Key tip:** Choose frames that are wider at the bottom

**Avoid:** Top-heavy or oversized frames

### Diamond Face - Highlight Eyes
**Best choices:**

**Key tip:** Choose frames that highlight your eyes and brow

**Avoid:** Narrow frames

### Rectangle Face - Add Width
**Best choices:**
- Large, decorative frames
- Round or square shapes

**Key tip:** Choose frames that add width to balance length

**Avoid:** Narrow rectangular frames

## Additional Considerations

### Skin Tone

# Understanding Dry Eye Syndrome: Causes and Treatments

Dry eye syndrome is one of the most common eye conditions, affecting millions of people worldwide. If you've experienced scratchy, burning, or watery eyes, you might be suffering from this condition.

## What is Dry Eye Syndrome?

Dry eye syndrome occurs when your eyes don't produce enough tears or when your tears evaporate too quickly. Tears are essential for:
- Keeping eyes lubricated
- Washing away debris
- Protecting against infection
- Maintaining clear vision

## Common Symptoms

### You might have dry eye syndrome if you experience:
- Scratchy or gritty feeling in your eyes
- Burning or stinging sensation
- Redness
- Watery eyes (paradoxically)
- Blurred vision that improves with blinking
- Eye fatigue
- Difficulty wearing contact lenses
- Light sensitivity

## Main Causes

### Age
As we age, tear production naturally decreases. People over 50 are more likely to experience dry eyes.

### Screen Time
Extended use of computers, tablets, and smartphones reduces blink rate, leading to tear evaporation.

### Environmental Factors
- Air conditioning and heating
- Wind and dry climates
- Smoke and pollution
- High altitudes

### Medical Conditions
- Diabetes
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Thyroid disorders
- Sjögren's syndrome
- Meibomian gland dysfunction

### Medications
Certain medications can reduce tear production:
- Antihistamines
- Decongestants
- Antidepressants
- Blood pressure medications
- Hormone replacement therapy

### Contact Lenses
Long-term contact lens wear can contribute to dry eye symptoms.

## Types of Dry Eye

### Aqueous Deficient
Your eyes don't produce enough of the watery component of tears.

### Evaporative
Tears evaporate too quickly due to meibomian gland dysfunction (blocked oil glands).

### Mixed
A combination of both types (most common).

## Diagnosis

At Eyesite Opticians, our comprehensive dry eye assessment includes:

1. **Symptom Questionnaire** - Understanding your experience
2. **Tear Break-Up Time** - Measuring tear film stability
3. **Schirmer's Test** - Assessing tear production
4. **Meibomian Gland Evaluation** - Checking oil gland function
5. **Corneal Staining** - Detecting surface damage

## Treatment Options

### Lifestyle Modifications

**Take Screen Breaks**
Follow the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

**Increase Humidity**
Use a humidifier, especially in winter or air-conditioned environments.

**Protect Your Eyes**
Wear wraparound sunglasses outdoors to reduce tear evaporation.

**Stay Hydrated**
Drink plenty of water throughout the day.

### Over-the-Counter Solutions

**Artificial Tears**
Lubricating eye drops provide immediate relief. Use preservative-free drops if applying more than 4 times daily.

**Eye Ointments**
Thicker than drops, ideal for nighttime use.

**Warm Compresses**
Help unblock oil glands and improve tear quality.

### Professional Treatments at Eyesite Opticians

**Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) Therapy**
Advanced treatment targeting meibomian gland dysfunction and inflammation.

**Prescription Eye Drops**
- Anti-inflammatory drops (Cyclosporine, Lifitegrast)
- Steroid drops for severe cases

**Punctal Plugs**
Tiny devices inserted into tear ducts to prevent drainage, keeping tears on the eye surface longer.

**BlephEx Treatment**
Deep cleaning of eyelid margins to remove debris and bacteria.

**Nutritional Supplements**
Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) can improve tear quality.

## Prevention Tips

1. **Blink More Often** - Especially when using screens
2. **Position Screens Correctly** - Below eye level to reduce eye exposure
3. **Take Regular Breaks** - Step away from screens
4. **Clean Eyelids** - Daily lid hygiene routine
5. **Omega-3 Rich Diet** - Include fish, flaxseed, and walnuts
6. **Manage Allergies** - Control underlying conditions
7. **Review Medications** - Discuss alternatives with your doctor

## When to Seek Help

See an optometrist if you experience:
- Persistent symptoms affecting daily life
- Vision changes
- Severe pain
- Symptoms not responding to over-the-counter treatments

# Protect Your Eyes from Digital Eye Strain

In today's digital world, most of us spend hours staring at screens – computers, tablets, smartphones, and TVs. This can lead to digital eye strain, also known as computer vision syndrome. Learn how to protect your eyes and stay comfortable.

## What is Digital Eye Strain?

Digital eye strain refers to a group of eye and vision problems resulting from prolonged use of computers, tablets, smartphones, and other digital devices.

### Common Symptoms

**Visual Symptoms:**
- Blurred vision
- Double vision
- Difficulty focusing
- Watery or dry eyes
- Burning or itchy eyes

**Physical Symptoms:**
- Headaches
- Neck and shoulder pain
- Eye fatigue
- Sore, tired eyes

**How Common is It?**
Studies show that 50-90% of people who work on computers experience symptoms of digital eye strain.

## Why Does It Happen?

### Reduced Blinking
We blink less when looking at screens (about 66% less!), leading to dry eyes.

### Poor Lighting
Glare from screens or surrounding light causes eye strain.

### Improper Viewing Distance
Sitting too close or too far from screens.

### Poor Posture
Neck and shoulder tension contributes to eye discomfort.

### Blue Light Exposure
High-energy visible (HEV) blue light from screens may contribute to eye fatigue.

### Uncorrected Vision Problems
Small refractive errors become noticeable during extended screen use.

## The 20-20-20 Rule

The most important habit to adopt:

**Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.**

This gives your eye muscles a break and helps reduce fatigue.

### How to Remember
- Set phone/computer reminders
- Use apps like "Eye Care 20 20 20"
- Stick a note on your monitor
- Use browser extensions

## Optimize Your Workspace

### Monitor Position
- **Distance:** 20-26 inches from eyes
- **Height:** Top of screen at or below eye level
- **Angle:** Slight downward gaze of 10-15 degrees

### Lighting
- **Avoid glare:** Position screen perpendicular to windows
- **Use indirect lighting:** Avoid overhead lights directly above
- **Adjust screen brightness:** Match surrounding light levels
- **Use task lighting:** For reading paper documents

### Screen Settings
- **Brightness:** Should match surroundings
- **Contrast:** Adjust for comfortable reading
- **Text size:** Increase if straining to read
- **Color temperature:** Warmer tones in evening

## Blink More Often

Make a conscious effort to blink fully and regularly:
- Remind yourself to blink
- Practice full, complete blinks
- Use lubricating eye drops if needed
- Consider a humidifier in dry environments

## Blue Light Protection

### What is Blue Light?
Short-wavelength light (400-495nm) emitted by digital screens and LED lights.

### Potential Effects
- May contribute to eye strain
- Can disrupt sleep patterns
- Long-term effects still being studied

### Protection Options

**Blue Light Filtering Glasses**
- Reduce blue light exposure
- May improve comfort during screen use
- Available at Eyesite Opticians

**Screen Filters**
- Physical filters for monitors
- Software filters (Night Shift, f.lux)
- Built-in device settings

**Device Settings**
- Enable "Night Mode" in evenings
- Reduce screen brightness
- Use dark mode when available

## Computer Glasses

Special glasses designed for intermediate distances (computer screens):

### Benefits
- Optimized for screen distance (20-26 inches)
- Reduces eye strain
- Can include blue light filtering
- Anti-reflective coating reduces glare

### Who Needs Them?
- Anyone spending 2+ hours daily on computers
- People over 40 (presbyopia makes focusing harder)
- Those experiencing symptoms of digital eye strain

### Available at Eyesite Opticians
We offer customized computer glasses with:
- Precise intermediate distance prescriptions
- Anti-reflective coatings
- Blue light filtering
- Personalized fitting

## Exercises for Eye Strain Relief

### Eye Yoga

**Palming**
1. Rub hands together to warm them
2. Close eyes and cover with palms
3. Relax for 1-2 minutes
4. Repeat several times daily

**Figure Eight**
1. Imagine a large figure 8 (10 feet away)
2. Trace it with your eyes slowly
3. Do clockwise, then counterclockwise
4. Repeat 10 times

**Near and Far Focus**
1. Hold thumb 10 inches away
2. Focus on thumb for 5 seconds
3. Focus on object 10-20 feet away
4. Alternate 10 times

**Eye Rolling**
1. Look up, circle eyes clockwise
2. Repeat 5 times
3. Circle counterclockwise 5 times
4. Helps lubricate eyes

## Lifestyle Adjustments

### Take Regular Breaks
- Stand up every hour
- Walk around
- Stretch neck and shoulders
- Look out windows

### Stay Hydrated
- Drink water throughout the day
- Helps maintain tear production
- Reduces dry eye symptoms

### Adjust Your Diet
Foods rich in:
- **Omega-3 fatty acids:** Fish, flaxseed
- **Lutein and zeaxanthin:** Leafy greens
- **Vitamin A:** Carrots, sweet potatoes
- **Vitamin C:** Citrus fruits

### Get Adequate Sleep
- 7-9 hours per night
- Gives eyes time to rest and recover
- Avoid screens 1 hour before bed

## For Children and Teens

Digital eye strain affects young people too!

### Special Considerations
- Shorter attention spans make breaks harder
- Still developing vision
- Increased myopia (nearsightedness) risk

### Guidelines for Kids
- **Under 2 years:** Avoid screen time
- **2-5 years:** Maximum 1 hour/day
- **6+ years:** Consistent limits
- **All ages:** No screens before bed

### Encourage Outdoor Play
- Reduces myopia risk
- Natural light benefits eyes
- Breaks from screen time

## When to See an Optometrist

Book an appointment if you experience:
- Persistent symptoms despite changes
- Worsening vision
- Frequent headaches
- Eye pain
- Symptoms affecting work or daily life

## Comprehensive Eye Exam

An eye exam at Eyesite Opticians includes:

1. **Vision Assessment** - Checking for refractive errors
2. **Eye Health Check** - Examining internal eye structures
3. **Discussion of Symptoms** - Understanding your digital habits
4. **Prescription Update** - If needed
5. **Recommendation for Computer Glasses** - If appropriate

## Prevention is Key

Don't wait for symptoms to develop:
